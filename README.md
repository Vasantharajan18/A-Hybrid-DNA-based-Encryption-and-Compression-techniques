# A-Hybrid-DNA-based-Encryption-and-Compression-techniques
Hybrid encryption system combining Caesar cipher, DNA encoding, LZW compression, and visual cryptography to ensure secure data transmission. This layered approach transforms plaintext into cipher text, encodes it into DNA strands, compresses it efficiently, and converts it into visual shares for high-level data protection and privacy
